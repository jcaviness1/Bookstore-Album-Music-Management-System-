# Bookstore-Album-Music-Management-System-
I'm learning how to use Golang



This project can be used as either a bookstore/music/album management system. 

Created using Visual Studio Code, Golang programming language and MySql database. 
Installed MySql and created a database to run the server/api.
Created a table called simplerest inside of database with the same name and a user known as 'jcaviness1' to grant specific access to that specific database and table. 

Used Postman to test the system.
